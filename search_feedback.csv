You really cannot find everything you are looking for and sometimes what you are looking for is outdated.
Would be nice if there was a boolean search function - to further refine the search.  And for a 'most searched' or 'most popular' drop down
When using search box it does not work very well in finding individuals / people, either as All Content or filtering to people.
When search a word I found too many similar information in different site, so I don't know which site I should access.
When adding content there are formatting issues.
Very unintuitive search results, and even when I know I need a colleague info, it's now several clicks through different menus rather than going straight there
Very difficult to find what I am looking for in most cases
Usually quick and easy to find things, however you could literally search for anything and everything.
Too many irrelevant results when I search. Also, I feel like what I need isn't showing up as a result - even though I know it exists on The Square.
todo excelente la funcionalidad es perfecta
There something about it that is not 'too user friendly'.  Some of the links sent me to docs that are not available.   I do not like the Company Directory set up for looking up colleagues.
There is still outdated information that appears and there are not enough promoted links for regularly searched terms
There is no ACROPEDIA. I am working with DEPARTMENTS and can't find their Names. This company is "alphabet soup." I use the search bar - NOTHING but the Acronym.
There are a few links that link out to 404 pages. Given all the content in the Square, the search landing page can be overwhelming to navigate when trying to search for a specific article.
The website is more user friendly, than before.
The Square is very informative and well designed to an extent however, it is difficult to search unless you have the specific language pertaining to the article/action.
The search is more efficient than previously; while it is still time consuming and not always successful to find something (a team, a process, etc) if you do not know the exact name or url, the new changes have bettered the odds.  Thank you for the continuous improvement.
the search is fast and i like the type-ahead feature.  however, the results are spotty.  sometimes i'm just looking for an individual's directory entry and either that isn't at the top of the search results or not in the search results at all.  relevancy of results could be improved.  i'd rather not have to click on 'view more' to look for additional entries
The search functionality returns irrelevant and outdated results. I almost never find what I am looking for using the search feature. Even when searching for people, if i don't filter to people using the radio button then they do not show up in the results. Often links are to pages that don't exist anymore ( I assume from before the migration a few years ago).
The search functionality isn't returning results which are aligned with the search. Felt the previous Square search was better.
The search functionality is terrible. It returns responses to the old square site and then I have to be redirected, the responses are not clear, and they filtering functionality is also not useful. If I don't know exactly what I'm looking for and how to get there, I try to avoid searching on the square as it's incredibly frustrating. I feel like there is so much useful content that is just not easily accessible or findable
The search functionality is still not as good as Amex Search. It's always a treasure hunt to find the official result for a tool or organization. For example, too often the top result for a tool is just the Central Record, rather than the actual tool URL. I'd suggest a way for teams to mimic SEO, such as being able to create certified results for official landing pages or elevate results based on senior leader sponsorship(approval). For example, this morning I searched for "American Express Policies". The top result should be the landing page for all American Express Management Policies (policy center). Instead I get a smattering of unrelated results and the one that appears best, 3 down, gives a 404 error. In the meantime, I'd suggest just directing users back to Amex Search which is much better.
The search functionality is better than it was, but the algorithm still seems to operate on an 'or' basis, rather than 'and'. So if, for example, I search for 'AIA calculator UK', I get lots of hits that just happen to contain 'UK' and are completely unrelated to AIA calculation.
The search function very rarely finds what you are actually looking for.
For example, if you search IRIS to find the Application Health and Exception Management Tool (which is widely used) there doesn't appear to be a way to navigate to this through the search tool. If there is a way, it doesn't appear to be intuitive.
The search function is terrible. The results will give you everything but what you are looking for. Results appear that are from items years ago or not relevant at all.
the search function frequently links to pages that have been moved and are no longer available. also it doesn't bring me to the pages that I want; a lot of useless pages often pop up and I abandon the search.
The previous search feature was easier to use
the new search functionality is worse than the old one. now if I search by a name, it will show hundreds of unrelated names and profiles, but not info webpages related to that exact person.
The new search functionality is non-intuitive, misses terms close to what is searched, gives completely meaningless results... For example, I should not have to know someone's middle initial to search them on the Square; if I had that data then I probably wouldn't be searching them on the Square. Also, if I type "Jen," it should intuitively search "Jennifer," or if I type "Mike," it should also search "Michael." All good modern search features can handle these basic asks. Names are just the tip of the iceberg too. I wind up asking others or giving up when I can no longer find things I used to find easily. Swing and a miss.
the latest uplift has really made a positive difference although there is still some way to go in terms of optimising results by fixing broken links, archiving legacy info and making better filters available.  Kudos to the team that carried out the work though: can't even begin to imagine the amount of legacy data hosted on The Square!  Keep up the good work! :)
Sometimes when I search, it presents links in the search results that give an error.
Sometimes the things I am looking for arent easy to find
sometimes its challenging
Sometimes I can't find something but generally it's good.
Some links are broken!
Since the revamp, it has been problematic more than usual and not consistent on performance. Even looking up simple names has on occasion proven to be a problem
Since the migration, it is increasingly rare that I am able to search and find resources I need and most often have to go to individuals to surface what I've spent several minutes looking for. Maybe naming conventions and guidelines would be helpful across all tools in the company? We deploy this with all processes now and it makes things easier to roll out across large numbers of people in various countries and markets. I'm sure this will continue to improve post-transition so feel badly for even scoring it this low to start.
See above.
searching is so inefficient !!!! hundreds of items found but not relevant most of the time. a nightmare
Searching is easy
Searching is difficult, especially searching for a person.  When I type in a persons name I don't expect to get a list of documents they edited before their profile.  Determining which record is their profile and which is a document is not visually easy to do.   I am in Canada but when I search for anything Canadian related even if I type in Canada first I always get US results first.
searching for colleagues somehow became much more difficult - search results seem to rarely yield in the top suggestions what it is i'm actually looking for
Searches bring up subject matter not relevant to actual words searched - and it's really slow.
Searches are still a hit and miss. Older pages are harder to find. Some searches yield non-relevant results.
Search usually brings up irrelevant results unless I search for the exact page/title.  If I'm searching, I usually don't know the exact term to enter and need to navigate through many pages until I find what I need.  Also, some pages lead to nowhere/broken links.
search shouldn't show pages i can't access
Search results too broad. I would like to see additional refinement.
Search rarely provides relevant results and still includes many broken links
Search provides anticipated words and suggested search options. Typically the results are reasonably accurate and/or provide a good line of sight to the purpose or intended target.
Search never yields most relevant results
search is still terrible, it doesn't bring up what i am looking for, then the search items (although filterable) being a long list of URLs looks poor, and it doesn't always work.
Search is much better than it was onJive.
search is a bit disjointed when entering a person's name.  when you try for topic searches, you don't get a preview like the old search page used to provide.
Search has been excellent in terms of finding self-help articles in the TechCare Portal. I love the filter to TechCare Articles (previously ServiceNow), but not everyone knows about this. Colleagues need to know how to leverage the search. Sometimes, docs come up that aren't relevant or are outdated. If there's a way to prioritize most relevant and timely, that would make AmexSearch even better.
Search functionality seems to be broken. Till past year, it was fine- now search results lack relevance and recency.
Search functionality is horrible.  Past dated documents .  Search for items and you get everything else but not what your looking .   Very frustrating but this is nothing new it's been like this before the new Square was launched.
Search functionality in itself is ok but with missing contents and broken links this is not helpful.
Search function appears no different from the original Jive platform
Search for my central didn't show the latest URL on top. Same goes with few other previous queries related to search.
Search DOES NOT WORK well - irrelevant content at the top of every search unless someone has manually pinned the result
Results need to be more intuitive.
Redirection was supposed to work for over a year....and it isn't.  Please fix it.
Only the search function I see with opportunity for improvement
not self explanatory
navigation is complex and some of the search results are not updated or accurate
My team needs to be able to search for Colleagues using only their AXP email address (that's often all that we have).  This is currently not possible using the new Square, so we search by name.  However, many Colleagues have similar or complex names, delaying the search.
My experience is that if I'm not very clear on what I'm searching for, it's very difficult to find information amongst all the other results that come up.
many times I end up unable to find specific content
Many previously saved sites were not migrated and am redirected to a legacy page.  Then I have to figure out how to search to see if potentially the site exists under a different name.
Large search results returned that have nothing to do with my search.
Just typing in a word , does not give the relevant information all the time. It is tedious to search for what one is looking for .
There should be a detailed How to for this
Its still very hard to search for things unless you know the terminology used to describe them.
Its good for when I need to search anything involving payroll. Otherwise I struggle with it.
It's very slow.  Most of the time I'm using it to look for a person, and that's not always the first info that comes up in the results.  I usually have to filter to see only those details.  In the old format, names often came up while you were still typing in the search box; that rarely happens in the new format.
It's not always easy to find things on the Square.  I'm not sure what the solution is but one thing that would be very helpful is easy to find contact information for everything at Amex.  Although I'm sure this would be challenging to create and maintain.
It would be better if it would show local information and the main page as the top link, not a random pdf.
it was easier in the past to locate colleague info/profiles (i.e. searching by ads id in the main search field)
It shows results that are the same or seems are very very similar so it's confusing.
It now takes too long to locate the things I need.  Sorry other than that, it looks good.
It is very difficult to search for things now, if you don't have the exact right word in the search, it is nearly impossible to find things.
It is very difficult to find anything.  Most times I am not pulling up what I need, even simple searchs don't bring me what I am looking for on the first couple of tries.
It is nice but we can do better, there is always an opportunity to improve.
It is impossible to find certain forms e.g. virtual work arrangments and almost 99% of search results are not relevant and do not provide correct information
It is a struggle to find things on the square.
It can take some time to redirect from old link to news ones. Wish that part was a bit more seamless.
informative
Information I can rely on
If I could give it a zero, I would. Search functionality used to be decent. Now it's useless after the migration that forced us to use AmexSearch.  I blame the former director who was more focused on getting a high rating than what the enterprise needed and would use.
I usually do not find what I am looking for in the search and it returns other things that are not related to what I am looking for.
i think when i use the searching bar is not looking for the most update information
I think there can be improvements on the search engine logic, using common acronyms and contact people names.
I really miss the ability to validate what Business Unit someone is in.  It was very helpful to see this.
I personally feel that the tool bar navigation has become more intuitive, and it becomes easier when they are clubbed in one section.
I often have difficulty finding information such as locating instructions on how to change your HSA contributions.
I miss the old square
I like the feel and look of The Square, but at time when entering key search words, it does not populate the information I need quickly. I am learning that I have to utilize other key words to find what I need and that can be challenging.
I haven't had any issues with it
I have seen improvements, since the change and I hope enhancements continue to occur to improve the overall experience.
I have occasionally used the search function to find policy info, training and process information - every time I search for a single or 2 word term I receive thousands of irrelevant results
I have had extremely little success finding content using the built in search.
I hate the new Square.  I spend half my day trying to locate information and then to click on an item to say the page is outdated and to click another area to them be told nothing available.  Extremely exasperating . Poor rollout.
I hardly ever find what I am looking for when I search. It often returns results for things that are irrelevant/outdated.
I find the old version user friendly specially for the articles I need to research
I find that the search function is not as simply as it was before. It is difficult to tell if the information provided is actually relevant for example, if I am in the UK and I am sure the system can tell my location, why bring up information on the same topic relating to other countries first. Surely it would be better to start with UK and then list other countries.
I find searching colleagues to be cumbersome and would like People Finder to be an icon on the Tool Box tab viewable on the home page. Maybe replace one of the icons such as Concur or Identity IQ.
I find it very difficult to locate spaces such as a business unit's space on the square because a ton of documents that might mention the area you are looking for pop up.  I wish there were a way to exclude documents in my searches.
I feel the org chart funtion could be simpler.
i don't really use the square as often
I don't find the search functionality very helpful at all.
I do not like looking up people separately from the main search.
Still the update grade all the old links have been broken and that data is no longer can be found.  Especially if departments didn't update the material and the it still relative. There should be an option to go back to old site and find what we are looking for and then report that it is not in the new site. (Note: There are too many new departments and people to figure out who originally own the material)
i cant find anything on here. it takes me several attempts at minimum. im constantly clicking on the wrong things. i cannot stress this enough - the website is so crowded with dense information. break these pages up so that you dont have to display like 80 different things on the same page.
I can't find what i'm looking for, even if have the exact title
I can typically find what I'm looking for.
I can no longer quickly access org charts when searching for a colleague. It used to bring me right to it when I searched for someone's name, but now the profile doesn't appear in search results.
I can never find anything in the square and many links are still broken too. There should be a way to prioritize official content over any content created.
I can get everything I need from here
I almost always find what I search for if it exists
Having trouble finding the information I am searching for.
Functionality is measured as 4 out of 5 in my opinion.
For betterment.
Finding people is a somewhat clunky experience.
Finding people in the directory is more difficult than the former Square. Finding documents that were moved from the old to the new Square is also very difficult.
Extremely unsophisticated "search" function hindering effective and efficient working practices.
Excellent
Everytime I search for Sunlife related documents (like the ADS Intranet access link to avoid Sunlife sign in credentials) or Canada related policies, I get really old information that is not relevant to my country location. I don't need to see the TLS info from a different market for band 30s from 2016 etc...when I search the word Canada, often the first result is someone named 'Donna Canada'
easy to find these using the search functionality
Easy and dynamic, User friendly.
don't know if it's me but search functionality is not intuitive at all. hard to search for people. also seems search has to be much more precise in wording or it won't come back with anything
content is very good.  once you get there after many.. many clicks.
Broken links, hard to find pages. Search engine populates pages that aren't relevant.
Because there is always room for improvement.
Because sometimes I can't find what I need.
Because not everything is easy or quick to find.
Because it mostly works but can generate too many less relevant results as well.
Barely had the chance to use The Square
Aside from growing pains such as broken links, the Square search functionality has improved.
As said above.
As a new employee to AMEX I often find that my searches on the square do not result in the information that I am seeking which I feel should be easily accessible on the square.
Are there any tips on "How to search"? When I try to search for any tool or application, the search returns a large number of pages. Most of them are expired and irrelevant. The search is fast though.
Accuracy of Search result need to be improved.
A lot of searches return a link that does not work
